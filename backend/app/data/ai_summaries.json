      "This lesson covers the core aspects of Installing VS Code.",
      "Key focus is placed on we and how it relates to the broader system.",
      "You will learn practical applications and best practices.",
      "The instructor emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying mechanism."

    "explanations": {
      "deep": "Technically speaking:\n\nThis topic touches on the lower-level abstraction of the system. When we analyze the performance implications, we see that optimizing this particular flow reduces computational overhead. The instructor touches on time complexity and memory management, suggesting that a declarative approach yields better maintainability than an imperative one in this context.",
      "simple": "Here's the simple version:\n\nThink of this concept like a recipe. You have your ingredients (inputs) and your final dish (output). This lesson basically teaches you how to mix them correctly so you don't end up with a mess. It's really about following the steps in the right order.",
      "example": "Let's look at a concrete example:\n\nImagine you are building a house. The concepts in this lesson are like the blueprint. You wouldn't start laying bricks without a plan, right? Similarly, in code, you define your structure before executing logic. For instance, if you were writing a function for this, you'd start by defining your variables (the bricks) and then write the logic (the layout)."
